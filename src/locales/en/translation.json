    "sysStatTitle": "System Status",
    "sysStat": "System status shows how your entire system is performing.\nBy monitoring and solving the four different tasks, you try to keep the system Health as high as possible and the Load as low as possible.\nWe will now go through the different tasks and practice them one by one before trying them all simultaneously.",

    "sysMon": "In this task you will check 6 gauges: F1-F6.\nYou need to correct the system if:\n• F1 stops being green - Correct by clicking F1\n• F2 becomes red - Correct by clicking F2\n• F3-F6 dot moves outside the gray center interval to the pink/red parts - Correct by clicking F3 – F6",

    "commTitle": "Communication Task",
    "comm": "In this task you must respond to audio instructions about changing radio frequencies. Some messages are addressed to you (your callsign), but you must ignore others (addressed to other callsigns).\nYour callsign is written at the top of the task (ESA504).\n\nControls:\n1. To select the radio to change, use [UP] and [DOWN] arrow keys.\n2. To change the frequency (number) for the selected radio, use [RIGHT] and [LEFT] arrow keys.",
    "resManTitle": "Resource Management",
    "resMan": "In this task you must maintain levels in the two main tanks (A and B) by using a set of reserve tanks and pumps, each with specific flow rates.\nYour task is to toggle numbered pumps on and off to get tanks A and B as close to their normal levels as possible.\nNormal levels for A and B tanks are indicated by the red line through the tank.\nPumps can sometimes fail, indicated by turning red.\nFlow rates for different pumps are shown below the respective pump (when active).\n\nControls:\nTo turn pumps on or off, use the number keys corresponding to the pump number.",
