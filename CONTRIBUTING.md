# Contributing Guidelines

## Commit Policy
- **Commit Early and Often**: Commit stable versions of the code frequently. Do not wait for large features to be fully complete if smaller, stable incremental changes can be committed.
- **Stable Commits**: Ensure the main branch always remains in a stable, buildable state.

## Version Control
- Push to the shared repository regularly.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
